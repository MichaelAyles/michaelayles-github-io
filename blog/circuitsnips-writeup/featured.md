## What It Does

CircuitSnips lets you search for common subcircuits - LiPo chargers, voltage regulators, protection circuits - and copy them straight into your KiCad project. No more reinventing the wheel for every weekend project.

The initial 4,000+ circuits were gathered from open-source GitHub projects, classified by license and quality using Gemini Flash 2.5. Users can upload their own designs, and there's box-selection in the viewer to grab just the portion you need from larger schematics.
