## Why Did I Make This?

What if DOOM's walls were actual PCB traces? What if enemies were QFP-64 chips and health packs were SOT-23 transistors? KiDoom answers these questions nobody asked, bringing the iconic first-person shooter to KiCad's PCB editor using authentic electrical components as the rendering medium.

The result: a fully playable (10-25 FPS) technical demonstration where component complexity directly reflects gameplay significance. Demons are intimidating 64-pin packages. Ammo clips are humble 3-pin parts. And every frame creates a legitimate PCB design that could theoretically be fabricated.

## What It Is, What It Isn't

### What It IS

- **A real DOOM port** - Uses the actual DOOM engine via doomgeneric, playing real levels with real game logic
- **Authentic PCB rendering** - Real `PCB_TRACK` copper traces, real `FOOTPRINT` components from KiCad's standard libraries, real `PCB_VIA` drilled holes
- **A triple-mode system** - SDL window for gameplay, Python wireframe for reference, KiCad PCB for the technical demonstration
- **A vector renderer** - Extracts geometry directly from DOOM's internal `drawsegs[]` and `vissprites[]` arrays (200-500x faster than pixel scanning)
- **An entity type system** - Custom DOOM patches extract real MT_* entity types, categorized into 150+ footprint mappings
- **Electrically valid** - All components connected to a shared net; the PCB could be sent to a fab house (it just wouldn't do anything useful)
- **A technical demonstration** - Proof that PCB editors are Turing-complete if you're creative enough
- **Playable** - 10-25 FPS depending on hardware, enough for casual gameplay

### What It ISN'T

- **DOOM running IN KiCad** - Let's be clear: KiCad is only the display renderer. The actual DOOM engine runs as a separate C process, sending vectors over a socket. If I wanted DOOM truly running inside KiCad, I should have written it in KiCAD's Python scripting engine. But that ship has sailed and I'm not rewriting it.
- **A pixel-perfect recreation** - This is wireframe/vector rendering, not texture-mapped graphics
- **Smooth 60 FPS gaming** - KiCad's PCB refresh is the bottleneck; this is a tech demo, not a competitive gaming platform
- **A practical use of your PCB editor** - This serves no purpose other than being delightfully absurd
- **A simple project** - Required patching DOOM's source, understanding KiCad's Python API, solving macOS threading issues, and implementing multiple coordinate systems
- **The first DOOM-on-everything project** - But it might be the first using real PCB components as display elements

## The Numbers That Made It Possible

The original concept was to render DOOM pixel-by-pixel using PCB pads:

```
320 x 200 = 64,000 pixels per frame
64,000 pads x 0.1ms per pad = 6.4 seconds per frame
= 0.15 FPS
```

**Verdict: Completely unworkable.**

The breakthrough: DOOM's engine already calculates visible geometry as vectors. PCB traces ARE vectors. Instead of 64,000 pixels, I need 100-300 line segments:

```
~200 traces x 0.1ms per trace = 20ms per frame
+ Refresh overhead = 40-60ms total
= 10-25 FPS
```

**Verdict: Actually feasible.**

## The Architecture

### Triple-Mode Rendering

KiDoom runs three parallel visualizations:

```
                 DOOM Engine (C)
                       |
                 Vector Extraction
                       |
            +---------+---------+
            |         |         |
       SDL Window  Python    KiCad
       (Gameplay)  Renderer   PCB
                   (Debug)   (Demo)
```

1. **SDL Window** - Full DOOM graphics at the top-left of your screen. This is where you actually play.

2. **Python Wireframe** - A pygame window showing the extracted vectors. Green wall outlines, yellow entity boxes. Essential for debugging.

3. **KiCad PCB** - The main attraction. Blue copper traces form wireframe walls. Real footprints mark entity positions. Centered on an A4 landscape page.

### The DOOM-to-PCB Pipeline

Every frame follows this path:

```
1. DOOM renders internally
   (BSP traversal, sprite projection, the whole 1993 magic)
        |
        v
2. Vector extraction captures drawsegs[] and vissprites[]
   (Screen-space coordinates, already perspective-projected)
        |
        v
3. JSON serialization over Unix socket
   {"walls": [[x1,y1_top,y1_bottom,x2,y2_top,y2_bottom,distance], ...],
    "entities": [{"x":160,"y_top":50,"y_bottom":100,"type":2}, ...]}
        |
        v
4. Python receives and parses
   (Main thread, because wx objects aren't thread-safe on macOS)
        |
        v
5. PCB elements updated in-place
   (Object pooling - no create/destroy, just SetPosition() calls)
        |
        v
6. pcbnew.Refresh()
   (The slow part - 30-50ms per frame)
```

## The Entity Innovation

The most satisfying part of the project: entities render as real PCB footprints, with package complexity matching gameplay significance.

### The Mapping System

| Gameplay Role | Footprint | Pin Count | Examples |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Collectibles** | SOT-23 | 3 pins | Health packs, ammo clips, keycards |
| **Decorations** | SOIC-8 | 8 pins | Barrels, dead bodies, torches |
| **Enemies** | QFP-64 | 64 pins | Zombies, demons, the player |

A Shotgun Guy is a 64-pin quad flat package. A medikit is a 3-pin transistor. This creates an instant visual hierarchy that any PCB designer would intuitively understand.

### The Technical Challenge

DOOM's `vissprite_t` structure doesn't include a direct pointer to the entity. The entity type IS available during sprite creation in `R_ProjectSprite()`, but it wasn't being captured.

**The fix:** Patch DOOM's source:

```c
// r_defs.h - Add field to vissprite_t
typedef struct vissprite_s {
    // ... existing fields ...
    lighttable_t* colormap;
    int mobjtype;     // NEW: MT_PLAYER, MT_SHOTGUY, etc.
    int mobjflags;
} vissprite_t;

// r_things.c - Capture during R_ProjectSprite()
vis->mobjtype = thing->type;  // Now I know what this sprite IS
```

The Python side maps 150+ entity types to three categories. The footprint pool pre-loads all packages at startup, so runtime is just position updates.

## The Challenges I Solved

### Challenge 1: Socket Timing

**Problem:** DOOM launches faster than Python can create the socket.

```
Wrong order:
1. Launch DOOM
2. DOOM tries to connect -> "Connection refused"
3. Create socket -> Too late!
```

**Solution:** Two-phase socket setup:

```python
bridge.setup_socket()        # Create /tmp/kicad_doom.sock FIRST
doom_process = Popen(...)    # DOOM can now connect immediately
bridge.accept_connection()   # Wait for DOOM's connection
```

### Challenge 2: Thread Safety on macOS

**Problem:** KiCad crashes when modifying PCB objects from background threads.

```python
# CRASHES on macOS:
def monitor_thread():
    if doom_exited:
        renderer.cleanup()  # wx.Timer from background thread = crash
```

**Solution:** Only clean up thread-safe objects (processes, sockets) from the monitor thread. Let KiCad's normal shutdown handle wx objects.

### Challenge 3: Coordinate System Confusion

**Problem:** Initial rendering appeared upside-down.

**Root cause:** Incorrect assumption about KiCad's Y-axis. Both DOOM and KiCad's screen display have Y increasing downward. No flip needed!

```python
# WRONG (caused vertical flip):
y_flipped = -y_centered

# RIGHT (both systems agree):
kicad_y = int(y_centered * SCALE)
```

### Challenge 4: Wall Perspective

**Problem:** Walls compressed to the top half of the screen instead of extending to the bottom.

**Root cause:** Using absolute world heights instead of heights relative to the player's viewpoint.

```c
// WRONG:
screen_y = centeryfrac - FixedMul(world_height, scale)

// RIGHT:
screen_y = centeryfrac - FixedMul(world_height - viewz, scale)
```

### Challenge 5: Portal Walls

**Problem:** Green wall polygons filled gaps where you should see through.

**Root cause:** DOOM's BSP creates portal walls (silhouette=0) for openings. I was rendering them as solid.

**Solution:** Filter by silhouette type:

```python
if silhouette == 0:  # Portal/opening
    continue         # Don't render
```

## Performance Reality Check

### What You'll Actually See

| Hardware | FPS | Experience |
|----------|-----|------------|
| M1 MacBook Pro | 15-25 | Playable tech demo |
| i7 + RTX 3050 Ti | 18-28 | Smooth-ish |
| Older i5 + integrated | 8-15 | Slideshow, but works |
| Standalone renderer | 60+ | pygame is fast |

**The bottleneck:** KiCad's `pcbnew.Refresh()` call. Everything else (DOOM, socket, Python) runs in single-digit milliseconds.

### Required Optimizations

Without these KiCad settings, performance is 2-5x worse:

1. **View -> Show Grid:** OFF
2. **View -> Ratsnest:** OFF
3. **Preferences -> Graphics -> Antialiasing:** Disabled or Fast
4. **Preferences -> Display Options -> Clearance outlines:** OFF

---

## The Visual Style

KiDoom's aesthetic is closer to Battlezone or Elite than modern DOOM:

- **Walls:** Wireframe boxes (4 traces each), blue (B.Cu layer), thickness encodes distance
- **Entities:** Real footprints positioned at entity locations
- **Depth cueing:** Thick traces are close, thin traces are far
- **Floor/ceiling:** Full-screen gradients from horizon (not per-sector rendering)

Think "1982 vector arcade game meets 1993 FPS meets 2025 PCB editor."

## Why This Exists

Because DOOM runs on everything. Because PCB editors have Python scripting. Because the intersection of those two facts demanded to be explored.

Is it practical? No.
Is it efficient? Barely.
Is it the correct use of a professional PCB design tool? Absolutely not.

But it works. And there's something deeply satisfying about watching a Cyberdemon represented as a 64-pin QFP package, rendered on real copper traces, inside a tool designed for designing circuit boards.

## Spin-off Projects

KiDoom's vector rendering approach has inspired additional experiments:

**[ScopeDoom](https://github.com/MichaelAyles/ScopeDoom)** - DOOM rendered on an oscilloscope in XY mode. Uses the same vector extraction pipeline from KiDoom, outputting audio signals that draw the game on an oscilloscope display. Some of the original ScopeDoom development code is still present in this repository under `scopedoom/`.

---

## Inspiration & References

The wireframe approach was partly inspired by **[DOOM on a Vectrex](https://web.archive.org/web/20250807100629/http://spritesmods.com/?art=veccart&page=5)** - Sprite_tm's incredible port that renders DOOM on a 1982 vector display. That project proved vector-based DOOM rendering was viable; KiDoom just substitutes copper traces for phosphor lines.

For understanding the fundamentals of how 3D rendering pipelines work (projection, depth sorting, the painter's algorithm), **[Yuriy Georgiev's polygon rendering tutorial](https://yuriygeorgiev.com/2022/08/17/polygon-based-software-rendering-engine/)** provides an excellent foundation. Many of the same concepts apply when extracting geometry from DOOM's internals.
