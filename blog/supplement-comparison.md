# Supplement Stack Saver: Budget-Friendly Alternatives

## Overview

The supplement industry thrives on branding and marketing, often charging premium prices for common vitamins and minerals. Supplement Stack Saver cuts through the marketing to reveal a simple truth: expensive branded stacks can usually be replicated with store-brand alternatives at a fraction of the cost—potentially **saving £65+ per month** while maintaining identical nutritional content.

## The Problem

**Premium Supplement Marketing**:
- Proprietary blends with fancy names
- Celebrity endorsements
- Premium packaging
- Complex ingredient lists
- High prices ($2-3+ per day)

**Consumer Challenges**:
- Difficult to compare actual nutrient content
- Overwhelming product choices
- Confusion about dosages
- Hidden equivalent products
- Time-consuming research

Many people pay premium prices for supplements when nutritionally identical store-brand alternatives exist at supermarkets for pennies.

## The Solution

Supplement Stack Saver automates the comparison process:

1. **Input**: Paste your supplement list or upload a product image
2. **AI Parsing**: Gemini 2.5 Flash extracts nutrients and dosages
3. **Analysis**: Matches against database of budget alternatives
4. **Output**: Shows cost breakdown and equivalent products

### Real Example

**Premium Stack**: £2.40/day
- Branded multivitamin: £0.80
- Premium Omega-3: £1.20
- Vitamin D3 capsule: £0.40

**Store-Brand Equivalent**: £0.13/day
- Supermarket multivitamin: £0.05
- Generic Omega-3: £0.06
- Vitamin D3 tablet: £0.02

**Monthly Savings**: £68

**Annual Savings**: £816
